# DianaChess

*** Please note that the chess engine was given by the course instructors. ***   
This repository contains the python-file **Atmaca_Sauter.py** which corresponds to a chess-agent. This agent was programmed for the dianachess-competition in the lecture 'Artificial Intelligence' by Prof. Zell and was able to achieve the 3rd place in the competition. The repository also contains the instructions (assignment08.pdf) and the final report (AdemAtmaca_AdrianSauter.pdf).

To run the code, navigate (via terminal) to the folder 'dianachess' and paste 
python3 ChessMain.py --agent1 MrRandom --agent2 Agent1 --verbose --use_gui

This will start a game between our chess agent and a random move agent. If you yourself want to play against the agent, replace MrRandom by Human, i.e. paste:
python3 ChessMain.py --agent1 Human --agent2 Agent1 --verbose --use_gui
