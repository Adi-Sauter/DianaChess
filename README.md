# DianaChess

*** Please note that some of the code was already given by the course instructors (see template file). *** This repository contains a python-file which corresponds to a chess-agent. This agent was programmed for the dianachess-competition in the lecture 'Artificial Intelligence' by Prof. Zell. 

To run the code, navigate (via terminal) to the folder 'dianachess' and paste 
python3 ChessMain.py --agent1 MrRandom --agent2 Agent1 --verbose --use_gui

This will start a game between our chess agent and a random move agent. If you yourself want to play against the agent, replace MrRandom by Human.
